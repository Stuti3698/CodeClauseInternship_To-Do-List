I've created a To-Do list application using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This application allows users to conveniently store and manage their tasks and responsibilities. 
With HTML, I structured the layout and user interface of the To-Do list, providing a visually appealing and intuitive design.
CSS was utilized to style and enhance the appearance of the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
The functionality of the To-Do list, such as adding, editing, and removing tasks, was implemented using JavaScript, making the application interactive and practical. 
This project reflects my practical application of web development skills to create a useful tool for task organization and management.
